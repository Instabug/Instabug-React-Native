 +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |  In this release, we’re improving the in-app communication experience.   |
 |  Now, your end user will have a unified experience while sending you     |
 |  a report independently from its type. Whether it is a bug, improvement, |
 |  or question, they’ll see the same experience.                           |
 |                                                                          |
 |  The Chats class and its methods have been deprecated, and while they    |
 |  still function, they will be completely removed in a future release.    |
 |  For more details about this API’s replacement, check the                |
 |  docs here:                                                              |
